# Understanding and Modeling Math Strategy Use in Intelligent Tutoring Systems

We investigate how students learn to apply context-specific math strategies by analyzing data from MATHia (a widely used Intelligent Tutoring System) collected from 655 schools in USA. In particular, we focus on a set of lessons designed to teach ratios and proportions where students learn multiple strategies individually, and then are presented with lessons in which they are presented with options to make a choice between strategies. Initially, students complete workspaces (a term used for a lesson in Mathia) where they learn to apply 2 strategies independently, i.e., 1. Equivalent Ratios (pre-requisite) and 2. Means & Extremes (pre-requisite). After this, they attempt a workspace called _Calculating Percent Change and Final Amounts_ where they are presented with a choice, i.e., there are two optional tasks that are presented to them one of which scaffolds the problem using the Equivalent Ratios (ER) and the other scaffolds the Means & Extremes (ME) strategy. 

## Knowledge Tracing

Learning to _recognize_ which strategy to apply is a skill that students need to master over time. We encode this skill as a hidden state in Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) and Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) models to predict future use of optimal strategies. Specifically, we model two skills that represent the studentsâ€™ knowledge to recognize the optimality of the corresponding strategies in the right context, namely __Recognize-ER__ and __Recognize-ME__.

> When ER is applied to a problem that is optimal for ER, we assign that observation as a positive label for Recognize-ER else we assign a negative label for that observation.

> Similarly, we assign labels for Recognize-ME based on whether we observe ME was applied to a problem where it was the optimal strategy.


For BKT to predict the use of future optimal strategy on sample test data, use the following code
> python trace_models/bkt_model.py 

## Generation using LLMs

We evaluated the effect _adaptive supports_ from the data of this workspace. Using LLMs to generate student strategies can significantly scale-up testing and validation of hypotheses by reducing/eliminating the need for large-scale data collection. To evaluate its feasibility, we task the LLM to generate student strategies and analyze the effect of the _adaptive supports_, and compare this with our observations from the real data.
